# Predicting-Book-Ratings
Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a book will receive a high average rating (4.0 or above) using book metadata and user engagement data. The goal is to demonstrate how predictive analytics can support data-driven business decisions, such as content ranking, recommendation systems, and marketing prioritization.

The analysis follows an end-to-end workflow including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models were trained and compared, with Gradient Boosting selected as the final model based on overall performance and stability.
